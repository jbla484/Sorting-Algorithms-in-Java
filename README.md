# Sorting-Algorithms-in-Java

Sorting algorithms are used to order items in an array. The efficiency of any sorting algorithm is determined by the time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm. Here is my implementation of some of the popular sorting algorithms in Java.

* BubbleSort
* SelectionSort
* InsertionSort

## BubbleSort

In bubble sort, we start at the beginning of the array and swap the first two elements if the first is greater than the second. Then, we go to the next pair, and so on, continuously making sweeps of the array until it's sorted
