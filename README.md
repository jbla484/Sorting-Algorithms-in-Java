# Sorting-Algorithms-in-Java

Sorting algorithms are used to order items in an array. The efficiency of any sorting algorithm is determined by the time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm. Here is my implementation of some of the popular sorting algorithms in Java.

* BubbleSort
* SelectionSort
* InsertionSort

## BubbleSort

With the bubble sort algorithm, we start at the beginning of the array and swap the first two elements if the first is greater than the second. Then, we go to the next pair of elements, and so on, continuously iterating through the array until it's sorted.

## SelectionSort

It starts with the first element in the array (or list) and scans through the array to find the element with the smallest key, which it swaps with the first element. The process is then repeated with each subsequent element until the last element is reached.

## InsertionSort

It's a stable sorting algorithm that seeks to sort a list one element at a time. With each iteration, it takes the next element waiting to be sorted, and adds it, in proper location, to those elements that have already been sorted.
